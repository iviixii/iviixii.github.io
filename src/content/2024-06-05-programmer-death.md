The more that I use a computer, the more that I realize that using a computer all of the time is one of the worst things you can possibly do for your body.

Consequently, the more that your body deteriorates from using a computer, the less effective your mind you will be, too. All is interconnected.

In order to actually produce at your best, and create the things that you wish to create, you need to be doing the things that allow you to spend less time in front of a screen.

When you get there, you sprint. You do what you intend to do, get in, then you get out. Mercenary style.

You should be using your keyboard to kill. To get the idea and the work out there. Then, you can rest like a lion after the hunt.

What this means is that you no longer can use a screen to entertain yourself. You need to find other ways to entertain yourself (read a book or go outside).

No longer should you be doing anything on your computer that is not creative. Nothing should be done on a screen that is not moving the ball down the field. Otherwise, you will associate a computer with consuming rather than producing.

And, who is to say that your work cannot be fun?

Producing is one of the most enjoyable activities we can partake in, we have just forgotten it.

Every press of the key is getting me closer to the goal. Every line I write is changing the world. Nothing else matters. No news sites, no social media, no forums, no youtube, nothing.

Put a paintbrush in the hand of a real artist, and all he will want to do is paint.

Here is my schedule on the daily to produce more and spend less time in front of the screen.

# Schedule

5:00 - 6:30:
    Meditate
    Body weight, nervous system programming, stretching
    Drink One litre of water
    Change, shower, groom, get dressed

6:30 - 10:30: Work block One
    Get up from the chair every 30 minutes, stand for 30 minutes and sit. I set a timer, and every time it goes off, I do some sort of bodyweight exercise as a break.

## I am joking ... lol
Lets be real most of us don't have time or the spunk to keep up a crazy 6am workout routine.
I like my whiskeys at night, and stay up well past a reasonable hour. Instead the tips that I will share below should act more as suggested guidelines. Adjust accordingly to your schedule where ever you are in life.

### Tips
- Get up every 30 minutes, or change your posture
- Kneel on the floor, use a saddle chair, sit in lotus, etc.
- Dont fall into the trap of buying ergonomic tech gear, actions work better
- Every 3-4 hours, do a workout where you are 15 minutes removed from the screen
- Walk more (aim for at least once per day if not a couple walks outside)
- Lift more weights, hang from a tree or pullup bar if you have one
- Drink only water and tea while working
- Coffee in morning, none after 11am
- 6 days work per week out doesn't matter where, 1 day off of active rest
