Sometimes an output is known, but must work backwards to find the input.</p>\n<p>If you know the output you want in your life - a certain career, net worth, significant other, location in which you reside - you need to select the inputs that will get you to that destination.</p>\n<p>Work backwards to get to where you want to go.</p>\n<p>You can whittle down much of your life to the things that you allow to influence you, your inputs.</p>\n<p>You become the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with. You become the podcasts you listen to, the media you consume, the shows you watch, the music you listen to. You become the city in which you live, the Sunlight you take in, the nature you do or do not participate in.</p>\n<h2 id="mornings-should-be-without-input">Mornings should be without input</h2>\n<p>In the morning, do not allow inputs.</p>\n<p>Most people start their days by reading the news, listening to podcasts, catching up on social media, whatever.</p>\n<p>The biggest change in your mood will come when you cease this activity altogether and focus on outputting first thing. You need to stop allowing just anything to come into your headspace and dictate the day that you are moving forward into.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t allow outside forces that aren\u2019t within my control to dictate the trajectory of my day. I will only read things that I know are positive, or something that will make me a better, more well-rounded person. I do not have my phone on for a few hours to begin the day, I don\u2019t want to be dragged one way or another when I know it won\u2019t aid me in getting closer to the place I want to go.</p>\n<p>In the evening, that is when I allow myself inputs that I cannot control. That being said, I am still careful to curate them. I don\u2019t want negative energies in my life. So, if a movie or a podcast or something I am consuming has a negative overtone, I shut it off. I am very particular about guarding my energy.</p>\n<p>You can curate the people that you follow: on Twitter, I am careful to only follow people that I find inspirational or people that are saying valuable things that resonate with me. I regularly unfollow people if they get into a negative content pattern or they no longer serve my higher purpose.</p>\n<p>Be highly cognizant of the things that you put into your body and mind. Because you become them; energy is not created or destroyed.</p>\n<p>Until next time.</p>\n';
