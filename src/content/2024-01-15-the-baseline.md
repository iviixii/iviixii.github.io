There is a baseline that you should strive for. An **everyday, non-negotiable, automatically programmed baseline.**

It should look something like this:

**Get sweat** coming out of your pores.

**Eat nothing that your ancestors would not eat.**

Get cold water on you. Feel the dread, the flinch - and do it anyway.

**Spend time inside of yourself**. And outside of yourself.

Pick three needle-moving goals. **Accomplish them.**

Spend next to no time consuming. Spend the vast majority **creating, building, seeking, learning, growing.**

Tidy your space for a few minutes. Consistency births more than a sprint.

**Challenge yourself.**

Spend time with people that make you feel complete.

Do nothing that you would hate yourself for. **Do not give into vice.**

Sleep well knowing you **did all the right things.**

Get up, and do it again tomorrow.

This is the bare minimum.

**This is your new baseline.**
