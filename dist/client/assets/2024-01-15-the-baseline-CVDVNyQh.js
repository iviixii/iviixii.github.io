<p>There is a baseline that you should strive for. An <strong>everyday, non-negotiable, automatically programmed baseline.</strong></p>
<p>It should look something like this:</p>
<p><strong>Get sweat</strong> coming out of your pores.</p>
<p><strong>Eat nothing that your ancestors would not eat.</strong></p>
<p>Get cold water on you. Feel the dread, the flinch - and do it anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Spend time inside of yourself</strong>. And outside of yourself.</p>
<p>Pick three needle-moving goals. <strong>Accomplish them.</strong></p>
<p>Spend next to no time consuming. Spend the vast majority <strong>creating, building, seeking, learning, growing.</strong></p>
<p>Tidy your space for a few minutes. Consistency births more than a sprint.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge yourself.</strong></p>
<p>Spend time with people that make you feel complete.</p>
<p>Do nothing that you would hate yourself for. <strong>Do not give into vice.</strong></p>
<p>Sleep well knowing you <strong>did all the right things.</strong></p>
<p>Get up, and do it again tomorrow.</p>
<p>This is the bare minimum.</p>
<p><strong>This is your new baseline.</strong></p>
